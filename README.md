k-NN-based mapping of cells across representations to tranfer labels, embeddings and expression values. Works for millions of cells, on CPU and GPU, across molecular modalities, between spatial and non-spatial data, for arbitrary query and reference datasets. Using [faiss][] to compute k-NN graphs, CellMapper takes about 30 seconds to transfer cell type labels from 1.5M cells to 1.5M cells on a single RTX 4090 with 60 GB CPU memory.

Inspired by scanpy's [ingest][] and the [HNOCA-tools][] packages. Check out the [docs][] to learn more, in particular our [tutorials][].

## Key use cases

- Transfer cell type labels and expression values from dissociated to spatial datasets.
- Transfer embeddings between arbitrary query and reference datasets.
- Compute presence scores for query datasets in large reference atlasses.
- Identify niches in spatial datasets by contextualizing latent spaces in spatial coordinates.
- Evaluate the results of transferring labels, embeddings and feature spaces using a variety of metrics.

The core idea of `CellMapper` is to separate the method (k-NN graph with some kernel applied to get a mapping matrix) from the application (mapping across arbitrary representations), to be flexible and fast. The tool currently supports [pynndescent][], [sklearn][], [faiss][] and [rapids][] for neighborhood search, implements a variety of graph kernels, and is closely integrated with `AnnData` objects.

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.10 or newer installed on your system.
If you don't have Python installed, we recommend installing [uv][].

There are two alternative options to install ``cellmapper``:

- Install the latest release from [PyPI][]:

  ```bash
  pip install cellmapper
  ```

- Install the latest development version:

  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/quadbio/cellmapper.git@main
  ```

## Getting started

This package assumes that you have ``query`` and ``reference`` AnnData objects, with a joint embedding computed and stored in ``.obsm``. We explicilty do not compute this joint embedding, but there are plenty of method you can use to get such joint embeddings, e.g. [GimVI][] or [ENVI][] for spatial mapping, [GLUE][], [MIDAS][] and [MOFA+][] for modality translation, and [scVI][], [scANVI][] and [scArches][] for query-to-reference mapping - this is just a small selection!

With a joint embedding in ``.obsm["X_joint"]`` at hand, the simplest way to use ``CellMapper`` is as follows:
```Python
from cellmapper import CellMapper

cmap = CellMapper(query, reference).map(
    use_rep="X_joint", obs_keys="celltype", obsm_keys="X_umap", layer_key="X"
    )
```

This will transfer data from the reference to the query dataset, including celltype labels stored in ``reference.obs``, a UMAP embedding stored in ``reference.obsm``, and expression values stored in ``reference.X``.

There are many ways to customize this, e.g. use different ways to compute k-NN graphs and to turn them into mapping matrices, and we implement a few methods to evaluate whether your k-NN transfer was sucessful. The tool also implements a `self-mapping` mode (only a query object, no reference), which is useful for spatial contextualization. Check out the [docs][] to learn more.
